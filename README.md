# Tic Tac Toe
This is a simple implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game using Java. The game allows two players to play against each other on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking their symbols (X or O) in the empty cells of the grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.

## How to Play
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your favorite Java IDE _(IntelliJ IDEA is great)_.
3. Compile and run the `TicTacToe.java` file.
4. Follow the prompts in the console to play the game.

To compile and run the program, you can use the following commands in your terminal: _(make sure you are in the project directory, where the `Main.java` file is located)_
```bash
javac Main.java # To compile the program
java Main # To run the program
```
